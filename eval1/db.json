      "ingredients": "Mix Vegetables. I add a mix of veggies like cauliflower, carrots, potatoes, capsicum and green peas.",
      "time": "30",
      "instructions": "My recipe traces back to my teens when I would make this delightful dish for my parents and sister. Whenever we would go to Juhu beach in Mumbai, pav bhaji was one snack we would always gorge upon.  I have fond memories of savoring pav bhaji and other Mumbai street food snacks in my childhood at Juhu beach. And it is from this place that I have picked up the fine nuances and inspiration of making this decades old recipe.  To make my version, specifically the bhaji – onion, ginger-garlic paste, tomatoes, are sautéed in butter first. Later to which boiled and mashed vegetables are added followed by pav bhaji masala.  The bhaji or vegetable gravy is simmered for some minutes and served steaming hot with buttered and lightly toasted bread rolls.  While in the streets and in restaurants, they make pav bhaji on a large flat tawa (griddle). But when making at home you can easily use a wok (kadai) or skillet or a frying pan.  Ingre",
